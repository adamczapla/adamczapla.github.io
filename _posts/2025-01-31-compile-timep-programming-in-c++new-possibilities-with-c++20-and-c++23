## Introduction

Efficiency is a key factor in modern C++ projects. Especially in performance-critical applications, it is beneficial to avoid expensive memory allocations and runtime computations. The new features in C++20 and C++23 greatly expand compile-time programming, allowing even non-literal types like std::string and std::vector to be processed at compile time.

In this article, I will show a concrete example of how to efficiently convert std::string into std::string_view at compile time. This reduces runtime costs, avoids unnecessary dynamic memory allocations, and enables new optimizations â€“ such as for logging or generated code metadata. In addition to the new language features, I will explain fundamental concepts of compile-time programming and present practical solutions to common challenges.
