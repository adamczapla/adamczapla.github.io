## Introduction

When working with `constexpr` and `consteval` in C++, developers may run into some limitations when attempting to evaluate conditions at compile-time. 

One common scenario is using `std::is_constant_evaluated()` to differentiate between compile-time and runtime code. However, there are cases where this approach fails due to how the compiler performs static analysis.

In this post, weâ€™ll explore how `if consteval` solves these issues, and why it is a better choice compared to `std::is_constant_evaluated()`.

### Why Doesn't This Code Work?

Consider the following constexpr function:
