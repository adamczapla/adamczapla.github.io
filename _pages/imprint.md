## Liability for content 

As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages in accordance with §7 Abs.1 TMG under general laws. However, according to §§8 to 10 TMG, I am not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances indicating illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. Liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete legal violation. If such violations become known, I will remove the content immediately.

## Liability for links 

My blog contains links to external third-party websites over whose content I have no influence. Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the sites is always responsible for the content of the linked sites. The linked sites were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. No illegal content was recognizable at the time of linking. However, continuous monitoring of the content of linked sites is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. If any legal violations become known, I will remove such links immediately.

Reproduction, editing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright law require my written consent. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. If the content on this site was not created by me, the copyrights of third parties are respected. Third-party content is specifically marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform me accordingly.
