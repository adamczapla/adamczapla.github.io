Email: adam@adamczapla.de

This privacy policy informs you about the processing of personal data when using this website.

## 2. Legal Basis for Processing 

Since this blog does not pursue commercial purposes, the processing of personal data is generally based on:

* Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest, e.g., to improve the website)
* Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent, e.g., when using the comment function)

## 3. Processing of Personal Data by GitHub Pages 

This website is hosted via GitHub Pages. When visiting the website, GitHub may automatically collect and process the following data:

* IP address
* Browser and operating system information
* Time and duration of visit
* Possibly cookies for session management

These data are processed and stored by GitHub. More information can be found in GitHubâ€™s privacy policy: 
https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement

## 4. Comments with Giscus & GitHub Discussions 

This website uses Giscus, a commenting system based on GitHub Discussions. To leave a comment, a GitHub account is required. The following personal data may be processed by GitHub:

* GitHub username
* GitHub profile picture
* Comment content
* Possibly IP address and additional metadata

Giscus loads external content from GitHub, which may result in GitHub collecting 	personal data. If you wish to delete a comment, you can either contact me or 	GitHub directly.

If you do not want GitHub to process your data, please do not use the commenting 	feature.

## 5. Embedded Third-Party Services 

Additionally, this website uses the Chirpy theme for Jekyll. Chirpy itself does not store or process personal data, but it may rely on external services (e.g., Google Fonts or other embedded resources). Please refer to the respective third-party privacy policies for more information.

## 6. Cookies & Tracking 

This website does not use its own cookies, analytics tools, or tracking. However, GitHub Pages may set cookies, particularly for session management or security purposes. If you wish to avoid this, you can block cookies in your browser settings or regularly delete them.

## 7. Security Measures 

I implement common technical and organizational security measures to protect the website from unauthorized access, manipulation, or loss. These include up-to-date encryption protocols, regular software updates, and access restrictions to administrative areas. However, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## 8. User Rights

* You have the right to:
* Access your stored data
* Delete your comments (through me or directly via GitHub)
* Withdraw consent to processing (by not using the commenting feature)

For inquiries regarding your rights, please contact GitHub directly or manage your 	privacy settings in your GitHub account.
